# Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## 1. Introduction

Password-based authentication is the most widely used security mechanism in modern digital systems. From email accounts to banking applications, passwords remain the primary line of defense. However, weak password practices and improper storage techniques make systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This report analyzes how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected, and provides recommendations for stronger authentication mechanisms.

## 2. Password Storage: Hashing vs Encryption

### Hashing

Hashing converts a password into a fixed-length string using a mathematical algorithm. It is a one-way process, meaning the original password cannot be retrieved from the hash.

**Example:**
